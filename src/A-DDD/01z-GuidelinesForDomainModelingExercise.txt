## Guidelines for Domain Modeling Exercise

The goal is to:
* Document the domain using AND and OR, etc
* Develop a shared mental model and shared language

Possible domains to use:
* ATM/Cash Machine
* Microwave oven
* Self-service espresso/cappuccino machine
* Delivery tracking service (e.g Fedex/DHL)
* Your own domain that you are an expert in



===================
How to model a domain
===================

* Pick one workflow to focus on.
  When that is done, do another one

===================
How to model a workflow
===================

* What is needed for the workflow input?
  * What data is from the triggering event itself
  * What data is from the current state of the system? E.g. loaded from storage?
  * What other data is needed?
* What is the output of the workflow?
  * What events are needed for broadcast to downstream systems?
  * What data should be saved to storage?
* How does the state of the system change?
  * Does data need to be loaded, changed, and resaved?
* What are the side effects? (Things that must be done but are internal to the domain)

====================
"Place order" Example
====================

Workflow: "Place order"
input:
  Order (from the triggering event)
  ProductCatalog  (to lookup prices)
output:
  OrderPlaced event (to be sent to downstream systems)
  The final PlacedOrder (to store in the database)
  An OrderAcknowledgment (to be sent to the customer)

---------------------------
Document the data with "AND"
---------------------------

data Order =
  CustomerInfo
  AND ShippingAddress
  AND BillingAddress
  AND list of OrderLines
  AND AmountToBill

data OrderLine =
  Product
  AND OrderQuantity
  AND Price

data CustomerInfo = CustomerName AND ContactInfo
data CustomerName = FirstName AND LastName

data BillingAddress = ??? // don't know yet



---------------------------
Document choices with OR
---------------------------

data OrderQuantity =
  UnitQuantity
  OR KilogramQuantity

data ContactInfo =
  EmailAddress
  OR PhoneNumber

---------------------------
Document simple/constrained types
---------------------------

data UnitQuantity = integer between 1 and ?
data KilogramQuantity = decimal between ? and ?

data EmailAddress = non empty string containing an @ symbol
data PhoneNumber = non empty string containing only digits, hyphens, and spaces
